## **Processes**  
- Cleaned CSV data for consistent formatting and usability using R.  
- Created the following visualizations and summaries:  
  - **Summary Interactive Table**: For a quick data overview (using the `DT` package).  
  - **Scatterplot with Smoothing**: Showcasing relationships between days of the week, bike usage frequency, and average ride time (in minutes).  
  - **Heat Map**: Highlighting the popularity of each ride type across Chicago locations.  

**See the `bikeShare.R` script for details on data cleaning and visualization steps.**

## **Key Findings**  
- Members have higher bike usage than casual riders on all days.  
- On weekends, both members and casual riders ride for longer durations than their average time.  
- Casual riders have almost double the average ride length compared to members.  

---

## **Summary Analysis**  
- **Ride Duration**: Casual riders spend an average of 25.3 minutes per trip, 97% longer than member riders (12.8 minutes).  
- **Usage Patterns**: Despite their longer trips, casual riders have lower bike usage across all days.  
- **Bike Preference**: Classic bikes dominate rides and are primarily used in tourism-heavy locations (e.g., Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr).  

### **Behavioral Insights**  
- **Members**: Frequent users, typically for shorter commutes (e.g., work or school), leveraging bikes as a cost-effective alternative to cars.  
- **Casual Riders**: Ride for longer durations but less frequently, driven by leisure activities, events, and tourism, especially on weekends.

## **Recommendations**  
1. **Geo-Targeted Marketing**:  
   - Promote classic bike rides in high-traffic tourist areas (e.g., Streeter Dr & Grand Ave) and use geo-targeted ads near hotels, tourist attractions, and event venues.  
   - Highlight the fun and recreational aspects of cycling to attract casual riders.  

2. **Tourism Collaborations**:  
   - Partner with local tourism boards to include cycling routes as part of Chicagoâ€™s tourism packages.  

3. **Weekend Packages**:  
   - Offer weekend-specific or event-based ride passes to appeal to tourists and leisure riders, encouraging longer rides and increased usage.  

4. **Localized Promotions**:  
   - Tailor campaigns for local neighborhoods with frequent member riders, emphasizing convenience and cost savings.

## **Further Study**  
- **Feedback Loops**:  
  - Conduct surveys for both casual and member riders to refine product offerings and improve marketing strategies.
